There once was a golden retriever named Ace. Ace was a majestic dog and had big dreams. He wanted to become the king of his native land Hawks Landing. His only problem was a troublesome hawk named Vince.
One day while Ace was playing outside, Vince starting cawing at Ace and his fellow dogs. Ace,wanting to become king, decided he needed to take charge. He barked and barked at Vince untilVince realized his caw's couldn't threaten Hawks Landing. Vince flapped away, unsatisfied with Ace being the "top dog".  
Vince, being the diabolical hawk he was, made a plan to take control of the landing. He gathered his fellow hawks and returned to the landing determined to take it back from Ace. Vince might of had some friends but Ace wasn't about to let them take the landing from him. Those   hawks didn't stand a chance.
